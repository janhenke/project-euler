# Project Euler

This repository contains my solutions for the problems from the *Project Euler* website
[projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net). The website provides a list of mathimatical problems for everybody to
solve. While you can use pen and paper, in most cases it is helpful to use a computer for the actual math. I use Python
for it.

**Do not spoiler yourself. The fun is about trying to solve the problems yourself. Do not lookup the solution from
someone on the Internet. If you are really stuck after some attempts, you can of course try to find some inspiration.**

My solutions are by far not always the most efficient or easiest. It is just my way of solving the problems. I do stick
to the general rule "The solution must be found in less then 60 seconds by the computer".

You can freely browse the files, but remember the above spoiler alert. The naming convention should be fairly
self-explanatory. Each file defines a `solve()` function, which returns the result, which can be used for an automated
retrieval / checking. I generally verify my solutions to provide a correct result, but in case of doubt check the
*Project Euler* website.
